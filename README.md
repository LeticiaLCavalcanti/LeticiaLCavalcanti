### Hi guys, welcome to my github page!

Passionate about technology since I was a child, I decided to study computer engineering to understand how things work from hardware to software and I fell in love with web development. In addition to valuing my career a lot, I contribute by encouraging more women and minorities to work with technology.

I need to be honest, I don't post as I would like here, so these repositories are just for my study and activities. I plan to publish projects and contribute to the open source soon. ðŸ˜…

for now you can find me at:
